</outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Unwanted outliers" _note="He&apos;s got a point."><outline text="Outliers can cause problems with certain types of models. For example, linear regression models are less robust to outliers than decision tree models."></outline>
<outline text="However, outliers are innocent until proven guilty. You should never remove an outlier just because it’s a &quot;big number.&quot; That big number could be very informative for your model."></outline>
<outline text="In general, if you have a legitimate reason to remove an outlier, it will help your model’s performance."></outline>
<outline text="We can’t stress this enough: you must have a good reason for removing an outlier, such as suspicious measurements that are unlikely to be real data."></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Missing data"><outline text="you cannot simply ignore missing values in your dataset" _note="You must handle them in some way for the very practical reason that most algorithms do not accept missing values."><outline text="missingness is informative."></outline>

</outline>
</outline>
<outline text="2 most commonly recommended ways of dealing with missing data actually suck."><outline text="Dropping observations that have missing values"><outline text="Plus, in the real world, you often need to make predictions on new data even if some of the features are missing!"></outline>
<outline text="when you drop observations, you drop information."></outline>
<outline text="The fact that the value was missing may be informative in itself"></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Imputing the missing values based on other observations"><outline text="the value was originally missing but you filled it in, which always leads to a loss in information, no matter how sophisticated your imputation method is."></outline>
<outline text="Again, &quot;missingness&quot; is almost always informative in itself, and you should tell your algorithm if a value was missing."></outline>
<outline text="Even if you build a model to impute your values, you’re not adding any real information. You’re just reinforcing the patterns already provided by other features"></outline>
</outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Missing categorical data"><outline text="simply label them as ’Missing’!"></outline>
<outline text="This tells the algorithm that the value was missing."></outline>
<outline text="This also gets around the technical requirement for no missing values."></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Missing numeric data"><outline text="flag and fill the values"><outline text="allowing the algorithm to estimate the optimal constant for missingness, instead of just filling it in with the mean."></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Flag the observation with an indicator variable of missingness"></outline>

We call it an &quot;ABT&quot; because it&apos;s what you&apos;ll be building your models on.&#10;Not all of the features you engineer need to be winners. In fact, you’ll often find that many of them don’t improve your model.

<outline text="Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets or CNNs)"><outline text="Deep Learning"><outline text=""></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Why convolutions?"></outline>
<outline text="3 types of layers"><outline text="Convolutional Layers."><outline text="process input data"></outline>
<outline text="Filters" _note="If the convolutional layer is an input layer, then the input patch will be pixel values.&#10;If the deeper in the network architecture, then the convolutional layer will take input from a feature map from the previous layer."><outline text="are the “neurons” of the layer"></outline>
<outline text="have input weights and output a value"></outline>
<outline text="input size is a fixed square called a patch or a receptive field"></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Feature Maps"><outline text="output of one filter applied to the previous layer"></outline>
<outline text="A given filter is drawn across the entire previous layer, moved one pixel at a time. Each position results in an activation of the neuron and the output is collected in the feature map. You can see that if the receptive field is moved one pixel from activation to activation, then the field will overlap with the previous activation by (field width – 1) input values."></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Zero Padding"><outline text="The distance that filter is moved across the the input from the previous layer each activation is referred to as the stride."></outline>
<outline text="If the size of the previous layer is not cleanly divisible by the size of the filters receptive field and the size of the stride then it is possible for the receptive field to attempt to read off the edge of the input feature map. In this case, techniques like zero padding can be used to invent mock inputs for the receptive field to read."></outline>
</outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Pooling Layers."><outline text="simplify it"><outline text="down-sample"></outline>
<outline text="reducing unnecessary features"></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Pooling layers follow a sequence of one or more convolutional layers and are intended to consolidate the features learned and expressed in the previous layers feature map. As such, pooling may be consider a technique to compress or generalize feature representations and generally reduce the overfitting of the training data by the model."></outline>
<outline text="They too have a receptive field, often much smaller than the convolutional layer. Also, the stride or number of inputs that the receptive field is moved for each activation is often equal to the size of the receptive field to avoid any overlap."></outline>
<outline text="Pooling layers are often very simple, taking the average or the maximum of the input value in order to create its own feature map."></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Fully-Connected Layers."><outline text="commonly attached to the final convolutional layer for further data processing."></outline>
<outline text="may have a non-linear activation function or a softmax activation in order to output probabilities of class predictions."><outline text="mostly using non-linear functions, like max"></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="used at the end of the network after feature extraction and consolidation has been performed by the convolutional and pooling layers"></outline>
<outline text="used to create final non-linear combinations of features and for making predictions by the network."></outline>
</outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Best Practices"><outline text="Input Receptive Field Dimensions"><outline text="The default is 2D for images, but could be 1D such as for words in a sentence or 3D for video that adds a time dimension."></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Receptive Field Size"><outline text="The patch should be as small as possible, but large enough to “see” features in the input data."></outline>
<outline text="It is common to use"><outline text="3×3 on small images"></outline>
<outline text="5×5 or 7×7 and more on larger image sizes."></outline>
</outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Stride Width"><outline text="Use the default stride of 1."></outline>
<outline text="It is easy to understand and you don’t need padding to handle the receptive field falling off the edge of your images."></outline>
<outline text="This could increased to 2 or larger for larger images."></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Number of Filters"><outline text="Filters are the feature detectors. Generally fewer filters are used at the input layer and increasingly more filters used at deeper layers."></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Padding"><outline text="Set to zero and called zero padding when reading non-input data. This is useful when you cannot or do not want to standardize input image sizes or when you want to use receptive field and stride sizes that do not neatly divide up the input image size."></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Pooling"><outline text="Pooling is a destructive or generalization process to reduce overfitting. Receptive field is almost always set to to 2×2 with a stride of 2 to discard 75% of the activations from the output of the previous layer."></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Data Preparation"><outline text="Consider standardizing input data, both the dimensions of the images and pixel values."></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Pattern Architecture"><outline text="It is common to pattern the layers in your network architecture. This might be one, two or some number of convolutional layers followed by a pooling layer. This structure can then be repeated one or more times. Finally, fully connected layers are often only used at the output end and may be stacked one, two or more deep."></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Dropout"><outline text="CNNs have a habit of overfitting, even with pooling layers. Dropout should be used such as between fully connected layers and perhaps after pooling layers."></outline>
</outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Uses"><outline text="Computer Vision: image recognition"><outline text="they operate on small subset of image"></outline>
<outline text="input window is sliding along the image, pixel by pixel"></outline>
<outline text="data is passed to convolution layers, that form a funnel (compressing detected features)"></outline>
<outline text="first layer detects gradients, second lines, third shapes, and so on to the scale of particular objects"></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="NLP"></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Worked Example"><outline text=""><outline text="Image Input Data"></outline>
<outline text="Let’s assume we have a dataset of grayscale images. Each image has the same size of 32 pixels wide and 32 pixels high, and pixel values are between 0 and 255, g.e. a matrix of 32x32x1 or 1024 pixel values."></outline>
<outline text="Image input data is expressed as a 3-dimensional matrix of width * height * channels. If we were using color images in our example, we would have 3 channels for the red, green and blue pixel values, e.g. 32x32x3."></outline>
</outline>
<outline text=""><outline text="Convolutional Layer"></outline>
<outline text="We define a convolutional layer with 10 filters and a receptive field 5 pixels wide and 5 pixels high and a stride length of 1."></outline>
<outline text="Because each filter can only get input from (i.e. “see”) 5×5 (25) pixels at a time, we can calculate that each will require 25 + 1 input weights (plus 1 for the bias input)."></outline>
<outline text="Dragging the 5×5 receptive field across the input image data with a stride width of 1 will result in a feature map of 28×28 output values or 784 distinct activations per image."></outline>
<outline text="We have 10 filters, so that is 10 different 28×28 feature maps or 7,840 outputs that will be created for one image."></outline>
<outline text="Finally, we know we have 26 inputs per filter, 10 filters and 28×28 output values to calculate per filter, therefore we have a total of 26x10x28x28 or 203,840 “connections” in our convolutional layer, we we want to phrase it using traditional neural network nomenclature."></outline>
<outline text="Convolutional layers also make use of a nonlinear transfer function as part of activation and the rectifier activation function is the popular default to use."></outline>
</outline>
<outline text=""><outline text="Pool Layer"></outline>
<outline text="We define a pooling layer with a receptive field with a width of 2 inputs and a height of 2 inputs. We also use a stride of 2 to ensure that there is no overlap."></outline>
<outline text="This results in feature maps that are one half the size of the input feature maps. From 10 different 28×28 feature maps as input to 10 different 14×14 feature maps as output."></outline>
<outline text="We will use a max() operation for each receptive field so that the activation is the maximum input value."></outline>
</outline>
<outline text=""><outline text="Fully Connected Layer"></outline>
<outline text="Finally, we can flatten out the square feature maps into a traditional flat fully connected layer."></outline>
<outline text="We can define the fully connected layer with 200 hidden neurons, each with 10x14x14 input connections, or 1960 + 1 weights per neuron. That is a total of 392,200 connections and weights to learn in this layer."></outline>
<outline text="We can use a sigmoid or softmax transfer function to output probabilities of class values directly."></outline>

<outline text="Feature rich:"></outline>
<outline text="Secure:"></outline>
<outline text="Scalable and powerful:"></outline>
<outline text="Speedy:"></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Disadvantage"><outline text="Known limitations:"><outline text="By design, MySQL does not intend to do everything and it comes with functional limitations that some state-of-the-art applications might require."></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Reliability issues:"><outline text="The way certain functionality gets handled with MySQL (e.g. references, transactions, auditing etc.) renders it a little-less reliable compared to some other RDBMSs."></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Stagnated development:"><outline text="Although MySQL is still technical an open-source product, there are complaints regarding the development process since its acquisition. However, it should be noted that there are some MySQL-based, fully-integrated databases that add value on top of the standard MySQL installations (e.g. MariaDB)."></outline>
</outline>
</outline>
<outline text="When To Use MySQL"><outline text="Distributed operations:"></outline>
<outline text="High security:"></outline>
<outline text="Web-sites and web-applications:"></outline>
<outline text="Custom solutions:"></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="When Not To Use MySQL"><outline text="SQL compliance:"><outline text="Since MySQL does not [try to] implement the full SQL standard, this tool is not completely SQL compliant. If you might need integration with such RDBMSs, switching from MySQL will not be easy."></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Concurrency:"><outline text="Even though MySQL and some storage engines perform really well with read operations, concurrent read-writes can be problematic."></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Lack of features:"><outline text="Again, depending on the choice of the database-engine, MySQL can lack certain features, such as the full-text search."></outline>
</outline>
</outline>
</outline>
<outline text="PostgreSQL"><outline text="Advantages of PostgreSQL"><outline text="An open-source SQL standard compliant RDBMS:"></outline>
<outline text="PostgreSQL is open-source and free, yet a very powerful relational database management system."></outline>
<outline text="Strong community:"><outline text="PostgreSQL is supported by a devoted and experienced community which can be accessed through knowledge-bases and Q&amp;A sites 24/7 for free."></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Strong third-party support:"><outline text="Regardless of the extremely advanced features, PostgreSQL is adorned with many great and open-source third-party tools for designing, managing and using the management system."></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Extensible:"><outline text="It is possible to extend PostgreSQL programmatically with stored procedures, like an advanced RDBMS should be."></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Objective:"><outline text="PostgreSQL is not just a relational database management system but an objective one - with support for nesting, and more."></outline>
</outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Disadvantages of PostgreSQL"><outline text="Performance:"><outline text="For simple read-heavy operations, PostgreSQL can be an over-kill and might appear less performant than the counterparts, such as MySQL."></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Popularity:"><outline text="Given the nature of this tool, it lacks behind in terms of popularity, despite the very large amount of deployments - which might affect how easy it might be possible to get support."></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Hosting:"><outline text="Due to above mentioned factors, it is harder to come by hosts or service providers that offer managed PostgreSQL instances."></outline>
</outline>
</outline>
<outline text="When To Use PostgreSQL"><outline text="Data integrity:"><outline text="When reliability and data integrity are an absolute necessity without excuses, PostgreSQL is the better choice."></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Complex, custom procedures:"><outline text="If you require your database to perform custom procedures, PostgreSQL, being extensible, is the better choice."></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Integration:"><outline text="In the future, if there is a chance of necessity arising for migrating the entire database system to a propriety (e.g. Oracle) solution, PostgreSQL will be the most compliant and easy to handle base for the switch."></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Complex designs:"><outline text="Compared to other open-source and free RDBMS implementations, for complex database designs, PostgreSQL offers the most in terms of functionality and possibilities without giving up on other valuable assets."></outline>
</outline>
</outline>
<outline text="When Not To Use PostgreSQL"><outline text="Speed:"><outline text="If all you require is fast read operations, PostgreSQL is not the tool to go for."></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Simple set ups:"><outline text="Unless you require absolute data integrity, ACID compliance or complex designs, PostgreSQL can be an over-kill for simple set-ups."></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Replication:"><outline text="Unless you are willing to spend the time, energy and resources, achieving replication with MySQL might be simpler for those who lack the database and system administration experience."></outline>
</outline>

</outline>
<outline text="Challenges of RDBMS"><outline text="a well-defined structure of data and assumes that the data is largely uniform."></outline>

</outline>
<outline text="As the data starts to grow larger, you have to scale your database vertically, i.e. adding more capacity to the existing servers."></outline>
</outline>
</outline>
<outline text="NoSQL (Apply Structure by not upfront)"><outline text="What is NoSQL?"><outline text="database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relation databases (RDBMS)"></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Benefits of NoSQL over RDBMS"><outline text="Schema Less"><outline text="do not define any strict data structure."></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Dynamic and Agile:"><outline text="have good tendency to grow dynamically with changing requirements."></outline>

</outline>
<outline text="Scales Horizontally"><outline text="scales horizontally by adding more servers and using concepts of sharding and replication."></outline>
<outline text="fits with the cloud computing services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) which allows you to handle virtual servers which can be expanded horizontally on demand"></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Better Performance"><outline text="All the NoSQL databases claim to deliver better and faster performance as compared to traditional RDBMS implementations."></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Some of these databases do not support ACID transactions while some of them might be lacking in reliability. But each one of them has their own strengths due to which they are well suited for specific requirements."></outline>

<outline text="Kernel" _note="A kernel is a similarity function.&#10;It is a function that you, as the domain expert, provide to a machine learning algorithm.&#10;It takes two inputs and spits out how similar they are.&#10;Suppose your task is to learn to classify images. You have (image, label) pairs as training data. Consider the typical machine learning pipeline: you take your images, you compute features, you string the features for each image into a vector, and you feed these &quot;feature vectors&quot; and labels into a learning algorithm.&#10;Data --&gt; Features --&gt; Learning algorithm&#10;Kernels offer an alternative. Instead of defining a slew of features, you define a single kernel function to compute similarity between images. You provide this kernel, together with the images and labels to the learning algorithm, and out comes a classifier.&#10;Of course, the standard SVM/ logistic regression/ perceptron formulation doesn&apos;t work with kernels : it works with feature vectors. How on earth do we use kernels then? Two beautiful mathematical facts come to our rescue:&#10;Under some conditions, every kernel function can be expressed as a dot product in a (possibly infinite dimensional) feature space ( Mercer&apos;s theorem ).&#10;Many machine learning algorithms can be expressed entirely in terms of dot products.&#10;These two facts mean that I can take my favorite machine learning algorithm, express it in terms of dot products, and then since my kernel is also a dot product in some space, replace the dot product by my favorite kernel. Voila!"><outline text="Why kernels?" _note="Why kernels, as opposed to feature vectors? One big reason is that in many cases, computing the kernel is easy, but computing the feature vector corresponding to the kernel is really really hard. The feature vector for even simple kernels can blow up in size, and for kernels like the RBF kernel ( k(x,y) = exp( -||x-y||^2), see Radial basis function kernel) the corresponding feature vector is infinite dimensional. Yet, computing the kernel is almost trivial.&#10;Many machine learning algorithms can be written to only use dot products, and then we can replace the dot products with kernels. By doing so, we don&apos;t have to use the feature vector at all. This means that we can work with highly complex, efficient-to-compute, and yet high performing kernels without ever having to write down the huge and potentially infinite dimensional feature vector. Thus if not for the ability to use kernel functions directly, we would be stuck with relatively low dimensional, low-performance feature vectors. This &quot;trick&quot; is called the kernel trick ( Kernel trick ).&#10;I want to clear up two confusions which seem prevalant on this page:"></outline>
<outline text="A function that transforms one feature vector into a higher dimensional feature vector is not a kernel function. Thus f(x) = [x, x^2 ] is not a kernel. It is simply a new feature vector. You do not need kernels to do this. You need kernels if you want to do this, or more complicated feature transformations without blowing up dimensionality."></outline>
<outline text="A kernel is not restricted to SVMs. Any learning algorithm that only works with dot products can be written down using kernels. The idea of SVMs is beautiful, the kernel trick is beautiful, and convex optimization is beautiful, and they stand quite independent."></outline>

<outline text="Data Engineer" _note="Data engineers are becoming more important in the age of big data, and can be thought of as a type of data architect. They are less concerned with statistics, analytics, and modeling as their data scientist/analyst counterparts, and are much more concerned with data architecture, computing and data storage infrastructure, data flow, and so on.&#10;The data used by data scientists and big data applications often come from multiple sources, and must be extracted, moved, transformed, integrated, and stored (e.g., ETL/ELT) in a way that’s optimized for analytics, business intelligence, and modeling.&#10;Data engineers are therefore responsible for data architecture, and for setting up the required infrastructure. As such, they need to be competent programmers with skills very similar to someone in a DevOps role, and with strong data query writing skills as well.&#10;Another key aspect of this role is database design (RDBMS, NoSQL, and NewSQL), data warehousing, and setting up a data lake. This means that they must be very familiar with many of the available database technologies and management systems, including those associated with big data (e.g., Hadoop and HBase).&#10;Lastly, data engineers also typically address non-functional infrastructure requirements such as scalability, reliability, durability, availability, backups, and so on."><outline text="The data infrastructure mentioned in the previous career path?

<outline text="Data Analyst" _note="Some of these shared skills include the ability to:&#10;•	Access and query (e.g., SQL) different data sources&#10;•	Process and clean data&#10;•	Summarize data&#10;•	Understand and use some statistics and mathematical techniques&#10;•	Prepare data visualizations and reports&#10;Some of the key differences however, are that data analysts typically are not computer programmers, nor responsible for statistical modeling, machine learning, and many of the other steps outlined in the data science process above.&#10;The tools used are usually different as well. Data analysts often use tools for analysis and business intelligence like Microsoft Excel (visualization, pivot tables, …), Tableau, SAS, SAP, and Qlik.&#10;Analysts sometimes perform data mining and modeling tasks, but tend to use visual platforms such as IBM SPSS Modeler, Rapid Miner, SAS, and KNIME. Data scientists, on the other hand, perform these same tasks usually with tools such as R and Python, combined with relevant libraries for the language(s) being used.&#10;Lastly, data analysts tend to differ significantly in their interactions with top business managers and executives. Data analysts are often given questions and goals from the top down, perform the analysis, and then report their findings.&#10;Data scientists however, tend to generate the questions themselves, driven by knowing which business goals are most important and how the data can be used to achieve certain goals. In addition, data scientists typically employ much more advanced statistical and modeling techniques, data visualizations, and emphasize reporting in a more business-driven storytelling way."><outline text="analysis and presentation of data"></outline>

These insights can be used to drive business decisions and changes intended to achieve business goals.&#10;This is done through business domain expertise, effective communication and results interpretation, and utilization of any and all relevant statistical techniques, programming languages, software packages and libraries, data infrastructure, and so on."><outline text="4 Pillars"><outline text="Business domain" _note="For example, a data scientist may think that her goal is to create a high performing prediction engine. The business that plans to utilize the prediction engine, on the other hand, may have the goal of increasing revenue, which can be achieved by using this prediction engine.&#10;While this may appear to not be an issue at first glance, in reality the situation described is why the first pillar (business domain expertise) is so critical. Often members of upper management have business-centric educational backgrounds, such as an MBA.&#10;While many executives are exceptionally smart individuals, they may not be well versed on all the tools, techniques, and algorithms available to a data scientist (e.g., statistical analysis, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and so on). Given this, they may not be able to tell a data scientist what they would like as a final deliverable, or suggest the data sources, features (variables), and path to get there.&#10;Even if an executive is able to determine that a specific recommendation engine would help increase revenue, they may not realize that there are probably many other ways that the company’s data can be used to increase revenue as well.&#10;It can therefore not be emphasized enough that the ideal data scientist has a fairly comprehensive understanding about how businesses work in general, and how a company’s data can be used to achieve top-level business goals.&#10;With significant business domain expertise, a data scientist should be able to regularly discover and propose new data initiatives to help the business achieve its goals and maximize their KPIs."></outline>

For example,&#10;A spying aeroplane takes photographs, which are used to figure out spatial information or map of the areas.&#10;Doctors use clinical expert system to diagnose the patient.&#10;Police use computer software that can recognize the face of criminal with the stored portrait made by forensic artist."></outline>
<outline text="Speech Recognition" _note="Some intelligent systems are capable of hearing and comprehending the language in terms of sentences and their meanings while a human talks to it. It can handle different accents, slang words, noise in the background, change in human’s noise due to cold, etc."></outline>
<outline text="Handwriting Recognition" _note="The handwriting recognition software reads the text written on paper by a pen or on screen by a stylus. It can recognize the shapes of the letters and convert it into editable text."></outline>
<outline text="Intelligent Robots" _note="Robots are able to perform the tasks given by a human. They have sensors to detect physical data from the real world such as light, heat, temperature, movement, sound, bump, and pressure. They have efficient processors, multiple sensors and huge memory, to exhibit intelligence. In addition, they are capable of learning from their mistakes and they can adapt to the new environment."></outline>

<outline text="Environment"><outline text="artificial environment"><outline text="confined to keyboard input, database, computer file systems and character output on a screen."></outline>
<outline text="Example: Turing Test environment"><outline text="The success of an intelligent behavior of a system can be measured with Turing Test."></outline>
<outline text="Two persons and a machine to be evaluated participate in the test. Out of the two persons, one plays the role of the tester. Each of them sits in different rooms. The tester is unaware of who is machine and who is a human. He interrogates the questions by typing and sending them to both intelligences, to which he receives typed responses."></outline>
<outline text="This test aims at fooling the tester. If the tester fails to determine machine’s response from the human response, then the machine is said to be intelligent."></outline>

<outline text="Properties of Environment"><outline text="Discrete / Continuous" _note="If there are a limited number of distinct, clearly defined, states of the environment, the environment is discrete (For example, chess); otherwise it is continuous (For example, driving)."></outline>
<outline text="Observable / Partially Observable" _note="If it is possible to determine the complete state of the environment at each time point from the percepts it is observable; otherwise it is only partially observable."></outline>
<outline text="Static / Dynamic" _note="If the environment does not change while an agent is acting, then it is static; otherwise it is dynamic."></outline>
<outline text="Single agent / Multiple agents" _note="The environment may contain other agents which may be of the same or different kind as that of the agent."></outline>
<outline text="Accessible / Inaccessible" _note="If the agent’s sensory apparatus can have access to the complete state of the environment, then the environment is accessible to that agent."></outline>
<outline text="Deterministic / Non-deterministic" _note="If the next state of the environment is completely determined by the current state and the actions of the agent, then the environment is deterministic; otherwise it is non-deterministic."></outline>
<outline text="Episodic / Non-episodic" _note="In an episodic environment, each episode consists of the agent perceiving and then acting. The quality of its action depends just on the episode itself. Subsequent episodes do not depend on the actions in the previous episodes. Episodic environments are much simpler because the agent does not need to think ahead."></outline>

<outline text="The 3 Elements of Great Machine Learning"><outline text="A skilled chef (human guidance)" _note="how to road-map your project for guaranteed success."></outline>
<outline text="Fresh ingredients (clean, relevant data)" _note="Garbage In = Garbage Out, no matter which algorithms you use.&#10;Professional data scientists spend most their time understanding the data, cleaning it, and engineering new features.&#10;While that sounds open-ended, you&apos;ll get our proven frameworks that you can always rely on as starting points."></outline>
<outline text="Don&apos;t overcook it (avoid overfitting)" _note="One of the most dangerous pitfalls in machine learning is overfitting. An overfit model has &quot;memorized&quot; the noise in the training set, instead of learning the true underlying patterns.&#10;•	An overfit model within a hedge fund can cost millions of dollars in losses.&#10;•	An overfit model within a hospital can costs thousands of lives.&#10;•	For most applications, the stakes won&apos;t be quite that high, but overfitting is still the single largest mistake you must avoid.&#10;We&apos;ll teach you strategies for preventing overfitting by (A) choosing the right algorithms and (B) tuning them correctly."></outline>

<outline text="Bayesian" _note="When referring to probability, there are 2 major schools of thought: classical, or frequentist, probability interpretation views probabilities in terms of the frequencies of random events. In somewhat of a contrast, the Bayesian view of probability aims to quantify uncertainty, and updates a given probability as additional evidence is available. If these probabilities are extended to truth values, and are assigned to hypotheses, we then have &quot;learning&quot; to varying degrees of certainty."><outline text=""></outline>
